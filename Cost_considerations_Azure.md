Cost considerations are based on a cluster running 5 hours daily on a monthly basis.

To estimate the monthly cost based on a Databricks cluster running for 5 hours daily, we'll need to consider the pricing for the Databricks cluster instance type (e.g., Standard_DS3_v2) and the number of nodes, as well as any associated Azure services like storage, Key Vault, and Azure AD integration. Let's break down the estimation:

• Databricks Cluster:
Determine the hourly rate for the selected instance type and number of nodes. For example, let's say the hourly rate for a Standard_DS3_v2 instance is $0.5.
Calculate the daily cost: 5 hours/day * $0.5/hour = $2.5/day
Calculate the monthly cost: $2.5/day * 30 days = $75/month

• Azure Storage Account:
Estimate the storage costs based on the amount of data stored in Azure Storage. Costs may vary depending on the storage tier (e.g., hot, cool, archive) and redundancy options (e.g., locally redundant storage, geo-redundant storage).
Use the Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate the storage costs based on your specific requirements.

• Azure Key Vault:
Estimate the cost based on the number of operations (e.g., read, write, delete) and the amount of stored data (secrets, keys, certificates).
Use the Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate the cost based on your usage.

• Azure Active Directory (AAD) Integration:
Determine if there are any additional costs for premium features or B2C/B2B scenarios.
Use the Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate any additional costs based on your requirements.

• Monitoring and Logging:
Estimate the cost based on the Azure Monitor and Log Analytics features used, such as data ingestion, retention, and log query volume.
Use the Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate the cost based on your expected log data volume and features enabled.
